# youtube-likes

Receive a notification/email when someone 'like's one of your videos.

Target usage:
- on a system that has cron emails enabled:
  - create a cronjob, with email activated,
  - that runs this eg every 15-60 minutes
  - be sure to copy `config.yml.templ` to `config.yml`, and fill in the api key etc
  - thats it :-)
